# SNA: Simon, Nikole, and Anthony

We are Simon, Nikole, and Anthony, mostly known for our amazing talents as marshmallow tower builders ðŸ˜Ž.

## Anthony

Hi, my name is Anthony and a quick fun fact about me is that my favourite animal is the cat (as evident by my GitHub username.) I like coding, music, and getting along with people.

**Hobbies:**

Some of my favourite hobbies are listening to music, coding, and watching Youtube videos about game design. Here is a [video I watched recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaOfb8FRfmE).

**Favourite Mario Characters**

I think your favourite Mario characters say a lot about you, so here are my top 5:

1. Mario

I love Mario as much as the next person, but not enough to put him higher on the list. Sorry Mario...

2. Bowser

The Koopa King is very cool. The one thing I don't like about him is that he dominates me at Mario Kart.

3. Luigi

I used to feel bad for him because he used to live in Mario's shadow, but nowadays he gets the recognition he deserves.

4. Toad

A lot of people find him annoying, but I find his demeanor funny and charming.

5. Bowser Jr.

Bowser Junior! Is he Bowser's biological son? Is he just a koopa Bowser adopted off the street? Who knows?! All that matters is that he's mischievous and funny, and he loves his dad a lot which I can only respect.

Finally, here is a photo of a funny-looking kitten which I cherish.

## Nikole (SooA Cho)

Hello, my name is Nikole. I adore drinking coffee and anything coffee related. I love stuffed animals a lot, and have a collection back home in Korea.

**Hobbies**

I'd say some of my favorite hobbies are playing video games, drawing, making music and streaming. I do at least one of them every single day.

**Other facts about me**

I do multiple things online as part time jobs. I do art commissions, fps video game tourneys, design commissions, manager for content creators, streaming, etc. At first, I started doing all of this for fun, but now I make enough to pay my rent and other living expenses.

Here's a character I really like, because I thought their design looked very cool!
